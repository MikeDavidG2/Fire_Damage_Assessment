"The script Process_DA_Fire_Data.py uses this script to control which fields to calculate and how to calculate them.  It will ignore the first two rows, and will ignore Columns B, D, F (which are used for human readability).  This CSV can pass the field name to use as the select field, the field name to calculate, and the calculation itself.",,,,,
